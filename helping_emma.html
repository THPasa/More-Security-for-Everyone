            <h2>What is Ransomware?</h2>
            <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that encrypts the victim's files or locks them out of their system, then demands payment (ransom) for the decryption key or to regain access. Typically, ransomware is delivered through phishing emails, malicious websites, or vulnerabilities in software.Once executed, ransomware can spread across a network, causing widespread disruption, data loss, and financial damage. It is a highly lucrative crime for cybercriminals, making it a constant threat to both individuals and organizations. If you would like to learn more about ransomware and how to protect yourself, you can visit the <a href="typeOfSoc.html">Type of Social Engineering</a>page for further details.</p>

            <p>One day, Emma received a professional-looking email claiming to be from a well-known software company. The subject line read: <strong>"Next-Gen Accounting Software - Try It Free for 30 Days!"</strong> The content was written in a corporate tone and included a convincing company logo. The email mentioned that a demo of the software was attached. Since Emma had heard of the company before, she clicked the link and downloaded the file.</p>

The "Dear Valued Customer" greeting is generic and often used in phishing or ransomware attempts to make the email feel official. The suspicious link in the email and the tone of urgency are classic tactics used to trick you into clicking or downloading something harmful. Furthermore, the request to not share this information with anyone is another suspicious action, often used to prevent you from consulting others about the potential threat. Always be cautious of emails that pressure you into acting quickly or clicking on unfamiliar links.</div>

            <p> Emma wasn't as cautious as you. Thinking it was a great opportunity from a trusted company, she downloaded the demo file without hesitation. But just moments after installing it, her screen suddenly went black. Then a chilling message appeared in bold letters:</p>
            <p><strong>"Your files have been encrypted. To regain access, you must pay a ransom."</strong></p>
            <p>Emma had unknowingly triggered a ransomware attack. All her important documents were locked, and the attackers were demanding payment to unlock them. Now she needs your help to understand how this happened and how to prevent it from happening again.</p>

            <p>After quickly disconnecting her device from the local network, Emma managed to prevent the ransomware from spreading further. But her own files ‚Äî and several company documents ‚Äî remain encrypted and completely inaccessible.</p>
            <p>A message on her screen provides a single option: pay a significant ransom in cryptocurrency to get the decryption key. The attacker even promises that ‚Äúcooperation will restore your data.‚Äù</p>

            <p>The best solution would have been to recognize that email link as suspicious and never click it. Emma missed her workplace cybersecurity training due to her heavy workload. Had she attended, she would have identified this message as a trap immediately.</p>

            <h2>Take a Moment to Think</h2>
            <p>After Emma's experience, she's now aware of how quickly things can escalate. The key lessons to remember to stay safe are:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Ensure Regular Backups</h4>
                <p>The most effective defense against ransomware is a proper backup system. Regular backups ensure that even if an attack happens, you can restore your files without paying a ransom.</p>
              </li>
            
              <li>
                <h4>Never Click on Suspicious Links</h4>
                <p>The best way to avoid ransomware is not to click on any suspicious email links. Always verify the sender, especially if the email seems urgent or too good to be true.</p>
              </li>
            
              <li>
                <h4>Stay Up to Date with Cybersecurity Training</h4>
                <p>Continuously educating yourself about cybersecurity best practices and emerging threats helps you spot and prevent attacks. Whether through formal training, webinars, or self-study, staying informed is key to protecting your data.</p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <h4>Research Before Taking Action</h4>
                <p>If you're ever in doubt, research before acting. Consult trusted sources, like your organization's IT team, or verify emails and links before clicking.</p>
