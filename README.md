# 🔐 Cyber Awareness Project: "One Click Away!" 🖱️

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to show how seemingly simple actions in our daily digital lives can lead to serious consequences — and how a few basic precautions can make our lives much more secure.

🚪 Leaving a digital door open is just like leaving your real front door unlocked.  
🧠 Through fun scenarios and practical tips, I want to show how **"a little awareness can make a big difference."**
