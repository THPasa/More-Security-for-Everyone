          <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
          <p>Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers try to trick people into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or financial details by pretending to be someone they trust, often through fake emails or websites. If you would like to learn more about phishing and how to protect yourself, you can visit the <a href="typeOfSoc.html">Type of Social Engineering</a>page for further details.</p>

          	<h2>Recognizing a Suspicious Email</h2>
            <p>It's often recommended to look for spelling mistakes or grammatical errors as a sign of phishing. While this might help in some cases, it's not enough on its own. Here are three important clues that can help you identify a phishing attempt:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>Copycat Behavior</h4>
                <p>Many attackers mimic everyday communication styles and company formats to make their message look familiar. If the greeting is vague, like <em>‚ÄúDear user‚Äù</em> or <em>‚ÄúValued client,‚Äù</em> it might be a sign that the sender doesn't actually know you</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>Sense of Pressure</h4>
                <p>Creating panic or urgency is a classic phishing tactic. If a message urges you to <em>act immediately, such as completing a task before a deadline,</em> take a moment to pause and question it.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>False Authority</h4>
                <p>Messages may appear to come from a known person or institution,<em> such as a manager, a colleague, or a trusted company. </em>This is done to gain your trust quickly and lower your guard.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h4>
                  Too Good to Be True
                </h4>
                <p>Attackers sometimes try to trick users with offers that are too good to be true. If an email offers you free gifts, unexpected cash prizes or extraordinary deals, there's a good chance it's a trap. These types of messages are usually aimed at getting you to take action without careful consideration.</p>
              </li>

          <h2> James needs your help üì©</h2>
          <p>James received an email inviting him to register NetSecure Solutions for a local cybersecurity expo. He had been hoping to join that event to raise the company's visibility. The email said spots were limited and urged him to act quickly. Without a second thought he clicked the link in the message. Immediately after the page loaded his antivirus software displayed a warning that a possible threat had been detected.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The email that James received was in fact a phishing attempt. It was very convincing especially because it matched his professional interests and current goals. It was an easy mistake to make. What James does next is what really matters.</p>

          <h2> James feels exposed üö®</h2>
          <p>The phishing email James received was crafted using publicly available information about him to make the message seem more believable. This digital footprint can include anything shared on websites, social media, or professional platforms.</p>
          <p>In James's case, the attacker took advantage of details he had shared on a professional networking site about his interest in educational events and innovation meetups. That's why the email inviting him to a digital education fair felt so real. Now James feels exposed and is eager to learn how he can better protect his personal information online.</p>
